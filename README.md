## Project: Serverless E-Commerce Platform

### Description
EcoShop is a serverless e-commerce platform where users can browse products, place orders, and manage their profiles. The platform includes user authentication, product management, order processing, and real-time analytics.

### Tech Stack Utilization

#### Backend Development
- **Java**: Backend development for handling business logic, product management, and order processing. Create microservices to handle different aspects of the application.

#### AWS Services
- **AWS Lambda**: Implement serverless functions for product listing, order processing, and user authentication.
- **AWS S3**: Store product images and static content.
- **AWS SQS**: Manage order processing queues to ensure scalability and reliability.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Create RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend and other backend services.
- **AWS IAM**: Manage access control and permissions for different AWS services.
- **AWS Cognito**: Implement user authentication and authorization.
- **AWS Aurora**: Use Aurora MySQL/PostgreSQL as the database to store user, product, and order information.

#### CI/CD and Infrastructure
- **Jenkins**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic testing and deployment.
- **Ansible**: Automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Git**: Version control for your project code.
- **Kubernetes**: Manage containerized applications (e.g., if using containers for some microservices).
- **Docker**: Containerize the application components for consistency across different environments.

#### Frontend Development
- **JavaScript / Angular**: Develop the frontend application for user interaction, product browsing, and order placement.

#### Search and Monitoring
- **Elasticsearch**: Implement search functionality for products.
- **Kibana**: Visualize and analyze logs and metrics from your application.
- **Grafana**: Monitor application performance and set up alerts.

### Project Structure and Implementation

#### Frontend (Angular)
- **Product Listing Page**
- **Product Detail Page**
- **Shopping Cart**
- **User Profile Management**
- **Order History**

#### Backend (Java)
- **Microservices for Product Management**
- **Order Management**
- **User Authentication**
- **Payment Gateway Integration**
- **AWS Services Integration**
  - Lambda functions for handling specific tasks like image processing, payment verification.
  - S3 buckets for storing product images and static assets.
  - API Gateway to route requests to appropriate Lambda functions or microservices.
  - SQS queues for managing order processing.
  - Cognito for handling user authentication and authorization.
  - Aurora for data storage and retrieval.

#### CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- Automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Ansible scripts for provisioning AWS infrastructure.
- Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

#### Monitoring and Analytics
- Elasticsearch for storing and searching logs.
- Kibana for log visualization.
- Grafana for real-time performance monitoring.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Version Control**
   - Initialize a Git repository and organize your project structure.
   - Create branches for different features and follow best practices for commits.

2. **Develop the Frontend**
   - Use Angular to build the user interface.
   - Connect the frontend with the backend APIs for dynamic content.

3. **Backend Development**
   - Create microservices in Java.
   - Use Spring Boot or similar frameworks to streamline development.
   - Implement the business logic for product management, order processing, and user authentication.

4. **Configure AWS Services**
   - Set up Lambda functions for serverless processing.
   - Configure API Gateway to route requests.
   - Use S3 for static content storage.
   - Implement Cognito for user management.
   - Set up Aurora for relational database needs.

5. **Automate with Jenkins and Ansible**
   - Write Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD.
   - Use Ansible for provisioning infrastructure and managing configurations.

6. **Containerize with Docker and Kubernetes**
   - Create Dockerfiles for your microservices.
   - Deploy containers using Kubernetes.

7. **Implement Search and Monitoring**
   - Use Elasticsearch for implementing search features.
   - Set up Kibana for log analysis.
   - Use Grafana to monitor application performance and health.

8. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Perform unit and integration testing.
   - Deploy the application on AWS and ensure all services are properly integrated.
